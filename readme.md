# GeoTwats

### What is this?

It's a python bot that streams Twitter, geolocates users and saves the details to a database, searches for a list of strings in tweet and if found sends alerts via email and sends DM to user. Logs hashtags alongside users in db. Use/edit read_db.py to read the data or something else... Maybes a sandwich!
